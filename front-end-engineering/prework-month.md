# Prework: If you Have a Month

Welcome to Turing! Your pre-work is broken up into a few different sections. Start off with the first week's suggested schedule. Once you've completed everything in the first week's schedule, move on to the Next Steps. If you still have time and would like to learn more, you may move on to the Extend Your Learning section. Before coming to Turing, please remember to complete Task G, the Pre-Work Reflection.

## First Week's Suggested Schedule

### Daily Tasks

#### Task A: Practice Typing

<http://typing.io> - Aim for 25 wpm without looking at the keyboard. Focus on Ruby, but other languages are also valuable practice.

##### Accountability Check

As you finish each level, save a screenshot of your progress and post it as a comment in your Gist (see Day One task).

##### Time Frame

10 minutes a day

#### Task B: Algorithmic Thinking & Logic

Sign up for a free account & do all of the free [Computer Science Warmups Concepts & Challenges at Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/computer-science/computer-science/types-and-data-structures/). Spread these exercises out over the next week as you see fit.

##### Accountability Check

Take a screenshot when you complete each quiz (Labyrinth Liberation, Dinner Date, Algorithm Accomplished) and post it as a comment in your Gist (see Day One task).

##### Time Frame

About 5 minutes a day.

### Day One

#### Task C: Create a public GitHub Gist

This is where you will keep track of your pre-work progress. Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/154921387) for instructions on forking the template I've created for you.

Use [this template](https://gist.github.com/mbburch/6800167c8e757c85f78b) for your Gist. Any time you add a comment to your Gist, reference the task label (A, B, C, etc.) as I've done in the example Gist. This will make it easier for you and your mentor to know what Gist responses go with which tasks. **Note:** When adding images to your Gist, make sure they are saved as a `.jpg` or a `.png` file.

##### Accountability Check

Share the link to your Gist with your student mentor. Check your email if aren't sure how to contact your student mentor.

##### Time Frame

10 minutes

### Task D: Set up your environment (Atom, Node, etc.)

<!-- TODO: Update this for Node/JavaScript. -->

#### Accountability Check

Respond to the following questions in your Gist:

- Did you run into any issues?
- How do you open Atom from your Terminal?
- What is the file extension for a JavaScript file?
- What is the Atom shortcut for hiding/showing your file tree view?
- What is the Atom shortcut for quickly finding a file (fuzzy finder)?

Type the following commands into your Terminal to ensure you have Ruby, RVM, and Git installed. Take a screenshot that shows the versions of each of these, and post it as a comment in your Gist:

- `which node`
- `git --version`

##### Time Frame

About 45 minutes.

#### Task E: Start learning to use the command line.

## Task G- Pre-work Reflection

To sum up your pre-work, answer the following questions in your Gist:

- Were you able to get through the work? Did you rush to finish, or take your time?
- What are you most looking forward to learning more about?
- What topics would you most like to see reinforced by instructors?
- What is most confusing to you about what you've learned?
- What questions do you have for your student mentor or for your instructors?
